# Aamir Sohail's inital personal website 🌐

This is the intial version of my personal website that I built using the [remote theme template](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter) for the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).

After discovering the (in my opinion more visually appealing) website template provided by [ai-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio), I ended up shelving this one and making a new one, which you can find [here](https://sohaamir.github.io/). I have decided to keep this repo open as a public archive instead of deleting it outright, to 1) make sure that my effort of making the website was not in vain, and 2) to keep it as a reminder that it is ok to shelve projects if you find a better alternative!
