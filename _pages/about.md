🏛️ I am a first year [MRC Advanced Interdisciplinary Methods (AIM) DTP](https://more.bham.ac.uk/mrc-aim/) PhD student based at the [Centre for Human Brain Health (CHBH)](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/centre-for-human-brain-health/index.aspx), University of Birmingham.

🧠 My research interests involve using a combination of behavioural tasks, computational modelling and neuroimaging to understand social decision-making, and using this knowledge to inform the precision-based treatment of mental health disorders.
  
🎓 Reflecting this, my PhD aims to use these methods to identify the neurocomputational mechanisms and associated brain regions affecting learning in social anxiety, and in a novel initiative, attempt to alleviate these changes using an mobile app-based cognitive therapy program. I am supervised by [Dr Lei Zhang](https://lei-zhang.net/) and [Dr Patricia Lockwood](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/psychology/lockwood-patricia.aspx) (Birmingham), [Professor Mark Haselgrove](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/psychology/people/mark.haselgrove) (Nottingham) and [Dr Jessica McFadyen](https://jjmcfadyen.github.io/) (Alena).

🌍 🏳️‍🌈 🌐 I am also passionate about facilitating inclusivity and diversity in academia, as well as promoting open and reproducible science. 
 
# 📕 Quick Bio 
I completed a BSc in Biomedical Science at Imperial College London, with my final-year project supervised by [Professor Anne Lingford-Hughes](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/anne.lingford-hughes) and [Dr Sam Turton](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.turton), followed by an MSc in Brain Imaging at the University of Nottingham under the supervision of [Dr Jan Derrfuss](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/psychology/people/jan.derrfuss) and [Dr Claudia Danielmeier](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/psychology/people/claudia.danielmeier). I then worked as research and administrative support at the Centre for Integrative Neuroscience and Neurodynamics (CINN) at the University of Reading under [Professor Anastasia Christakou](https://anastasia.christakou.org/). 

Outside of work I enjoy playing snooker 🎱 (high break of 63), going on meandering walks 🚶, watching cricket 🏏 and listening to music 🎶
