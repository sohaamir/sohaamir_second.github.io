🏛️ I am a first year [MRC Advanced Interdisciplinary Methods (AIM) DTP](https://more.bham.ac.uk/mrc-aim/) PhD student based at the [Centre for Human Brain Health (CHBH)](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/centre-for-human-brain-health/index.aspx), University of Birmingham.

🧠 My research interests involve using a combination of behavioural tasks, computational modelling and neuroimaging to understand social decision-making, and using this knowledge to inform the precision-based treatment of mental health disorders.

Reflecting this, my PhD aims to use these methods to identify the neurocomputational mechanisms and associated brain regions affecting learning in social anxiety, and in a novel initiative, attempt to alleviate these changes using an mobile app-based cognitive therapy program. I am supervised by [Dr Lei Zhang](https://lei-zhang.net/) and [Dr Patricia Lockwood](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/psychology/lockwood-patricia.aspx) (Birmingham), [Professor Mark Haselgrove](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/psychology/people/mark.haselgrove) (Nottingham) and [Dr Jessica McFadyen](https://jjmcfadyen.github.io/) (Alena).

🌍 🏳️‍🌈 🌐 I am also passionate about facilitating inclusivity and diversity in academia, as well as promoting open and reproducible science. 
 
# 📕 Quick Bio 
I completed a BSc in Biomedical Science at Imperial College London, with my final-year project supervised by [Professor Anne Lingford-Hughes](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/anne.lingford-hughes) and [Dr Sam Turton](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/s.turton), followed by an MSc in Brain Imaging at the University of Nottingham under the supervision of [Dr Jan Derrfuss](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/psychology/people/jan.derrfuss) and [Dr Claudia Danielmeier](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/psychology/people/claudia.danielmeier). I then worked as research and administrative support at the Centre for Integrative Neuroscience and Neurodynamics (CINN) at the University of Reading under [Professor Anastasia Christakou](https://anastasia.christakou.org/). 

Outside of work I enjoy playing snooker 🎱 (high break of 63), going on long meandering walks 🚶, watching cricket 🏏 and listening to music 🎶
